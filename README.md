# TDT4195 - Visual Computing Fundamentals

This is the repository for the assignments in TDT4195. All assignments are published as PDF's on blackboard, and have the following delivery dates:

1. Assignment 1: Friday October 23rd, 23:59 PM
2. Assignment 2 Friday November 6th ,23:59 PM
3. Assignment 3: Friday November 20th, 23:59 PM

The starting source code for each assignment will be published during the semester.
**Note that**  there might be bugs in the original starter code, therefore, please watch the announcements on blackboard in case we update the starter code.

## Assignment 1
This assignment will give you an introduction to basic image processing with python, filtering in the spatial domain, and a simple introduction to building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch.


## Assignment 2
We will introduce you to classifying images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and how we can use the frequency domain for image filtering.


## Assignment 3
We will explore how we can segment an image into foreground and background by using basic segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding and region region growing.
Furthermore, you will use  binary morphological operations to manipulate the contents of a binary image.




# Preparing yourself for the assignments
In this course, we expect basic knowledge of python programming and git. To refresh your knowledge, we recommend the following resources:

- [CS231N Python Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- [Jupyter notebook tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial/)
- [Introduction to git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)

If you need help with this, please visit our lab hours.


## Setting up your python environment

**NOTE:** This is already done on the cybele computers and the given server resources.

Follow our [python setup instructions](python_setup_instructions.md)


## Getting started

Clone this repostiory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hukkelas/TDT4195-StarterCode
```

You can also download this repository as a zip file and unzip it on your computer.


### Changes to starter code

There might be minor typos or minor alterations to the starter code. If this happens, we will notify you on blackboard and you can update your starter code by doing (In your assignment directory):

```
git pull origin master
```
